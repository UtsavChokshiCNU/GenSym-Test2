;;;; Gensym Window Geometry



;;; A gensym window is divided up into any number of non-overlapping,
;;; rectangular panes (see `pane-area-hack').  On each pane is a stack of one or
;;; more image planes.  An image plane may have on it a rectangular image of a
;;; workspace.  An image on an image plane occludes images on planes that are
;;; deeper down in its stack.  See below for further details.

;;; The term `area' is used to refer to an arbitrary rectangular window of a
;;; raster (or window, pane, image plane, image, etc.).  By convention, an area
;;; is represented by its left, top, right, and bottom `edges', in that order,
;;; where, for a non-zero-size area, left-edge < right-edge and top-edge <
;;; bottom-edge.  (When left-edge >= right-edge or top-edge >= bottom-edge, the
;;; area is of zero size.)  When the edges are viewed as raster subscripts, the
;;; upper left-hand corner pixel is at (left-edge, top-edge) and the lower
;;; right-hand pixel is at (right-edge - 1, top-edge - 1).  Thus, viewed as
;;; raster subscripts, the edges are asymmetric with respect to the raster area.
;;; The width of an area is given by (right-edge - left-edge) and the height by
;;; (bottom-edge - top-edge).

;;; Note that all raster graphics in an AB system should use rasters and raster-
;;; specific operations, as defined in module PRIMITIVES, especially for raster
;;; element access and raster arithmetic.

;;; A point, edge, or area is said to be `in' a pane if it is described in the
;;; coordinate system of the window and `within' a pane if it is both "in" the
;;; pane and located entirely within the pane rectangle.  Thus something "in" a
;;; pane is not necessarily "within" the pane.

;;;; Panes


;;; A `pane' is a rectangular region within a gensym window.  See
;;; `gensym-window-geometry' and `pane-area-hack' for further details.

;;; A pane has on it a `stack' of one or more `image planes': a `top plane' and
;;; any number of `buried planes'....

;;; Note that there is no guarantee that the stack of image planes will remain
;;; in any particular order, since planes may be shuffled arbitrarily during
;;; user interaction.  Furthermore, an image plane may be deleted during user
;;; interaction, and thus nothing should count on the continued existence or
;;; stack position of an image plane, except momentarily.

;;; A drawing schedule is stored in the pane to record drawing that has
;;; be deferred to allow the oportunity for other micro tasks to run.

;;;; Memory Management of Frame Descriptions

;;; Frame descriptions are instructions for how to wrap an item in a decorative
;;; and useful frame.  These frames contain scroll bars, and possible other
;;; controls.  Frames are described by frame descriptions, a list of
;;; instructions sort of like the body of a progn.  Frame descriptions are
;;; consed both at compile time, for the build in frame descriptions and at run
;;; time for the user's custome frame descriptions.  Frame descriptions are
;;; owned by global variables or by instances of the class
;;; frame-style-definition.

;;; Frame descriptions are named.  These names appear in object configurations
;;; to configure the frame placed around an object.  When an object actually is
;;; rendered the frame description is infered from the name, this is a little
;;; complex.  The first we look for a frame-style-description in the current kb,
;;; and then we look in at small build in set, finally we just use a default
;;; frame.  This technique allows users to override the build in frames even for
;;; objects that lack an ovious class upon which to modify the object
;;; configuartion, e.g. menus, dialogs, etc by defining a frame style
;;; description that is the same as the build in one.  Since this computation is
;;; a little complex we always cache the result of this look up in the
;;; items/image-planes being framed.

;;; This cached value is not invalidated when the frame-style-definitions are
;;; editted by the users.  That's sad.  To avoid reclaiming the frame
;;; description when such edits are done is managed by indirecting thru a small
;;; structure, the frame-style-reference, where in a reference count is used to
;;; manage the reclaiming.

;;; The lookup of a frame-style-reference given symbol naming a frame-style, aka
;;; a frame-style, is implemented by storing the frame style in the
;;; frame-style-description, and for built in frame-style-descriptions storing
;;; the frame-style-reference on a property of the frame-style.

;;; Frame descriptions are implemented in the module DRAW.  The
;;; frame-style-definitions are implement in the module FORMATS.  The
;;; frame-style-references are implemented in this module.

;;; In summary:
;;;    frame-style             -- a symbol in AB or KEYWORD
;;;    frame-description       -- a progn body like description of the frame
;;;    frame-style-definition  -- a class users use for customizing
;;;    frame-description-reference   -- a structure counting users of a
;;;                                     frame-style-description

;;; Frame-styles named by keywords are those that may not be overridden by the
;;; user.  Slots containing frame-style or frame-style-references may be nil,
;;; indicating that no frame is found on this object, this is the usual case for
;;; items.

;;; A `frame-style-reference' is holds a frame style description along with
;;; a reference count.  The place which defines a unique frame style maintains
;;; creates the reference.  A bit in the reference is set, a dirty bit, when
;;; that place notices that the description is changing.  Users of this frame
;;; description increment the reference when they start using it, and decrement
;;; it when done.  They may use the dirty bit to notice they should fetch a
;;; new, accurate frame reference from the place that defines thier frame.

;;; These are created via create-frame-description-reference in DRAW.

;;;; Image Planes



;;; An image plane is primarily used to show a workspace, or portion thereof,
;;; within a pane.  An image plane may or may not [at present] have a workspace
;;; on it, in which case it is said to have an `image' (of the workspace).

;;; The `workspace-on-image-plane?' links the image-plane to his workspace,
;;; the `images-this-is-upon' slot in the workspace point's back.

;;; The `pane-for-image-plane' slot is a back pointer to this image plane's
;;; pane, where he resides in the `stack-of-image-planes' slot.  Image-planes
;;; are part of the window display hierarchy, i.e. the tree of `gensym-window',
;;; `pane', and `image-plane'.

;;; The rectangle of an image-plane's enclosing pane is stored directly in
;;; the image-plane.  These values are in raster units.
;;;    `*-edge-of-pane-in-window'
;;; You would expect these to be stored in the pane, but they aren't.  The
;;; principle consequence of that is that even an empty pane has to have one
;;; image-plane, and we need a scheme to detect an "empty" image-plane.

;;; Image-planes have a decorative border drawn around them known as a `frame'.
;;; Inside of that frame we draw the workspace and it's margin.  The size of
;;; the frame is recorded in raster units in `*-frame-indent-of-image-plane.'
;;; The frame is not scaled image-plane is showing a scaled workspace.

;;; Two nested rectangles record the area the entire image takes and the
;;; workspace's rendering take.  These are all in raster units, and are not
;;; clipped to the pane boundries.
;;;     `*-edge-of-workspace-area-in-window'
;;;     `*-edge-of-image-in-window image-plane'
;;; The `workspace-area' is the portion of the image-plane which is displaying
;;; some portion of the workspace.  If you add the pixels for the `frame-indent'
;;; then you get the `edge-of-image.'  The edge-of-image is always larger
;;; than the `workspace-area'

;;; Those three rectangles, in raster units, are related to the workspace
;;; rectangles via scaling.
;;;    `{x,y}-origin-of-workspace-in-window'
;;;    `image-{x,y}-scale'
;;; This mapping is abstracted in the macros `{x,y}-in-window'.

;;; The displayed portion of the workspace is known as the content-area, this
;;; is recorded in:
;;;     `*-edge-of-content-area-of-image-plane'
;;; this rectangle maps directly into the *-edge-of-workspace-area.  Due to
;;; bleeding, icon overflow, and the rough nature of scaling the actual area
;;; rendered may include blocks that overlap this rectangle:
;;;   `loose-*-edge-of-visible-workspace-area'
;;; This is used for `quick clipping'.

;;; In summary:
;;;    - Workspace Units -                            - Raster Units -
;;;     content-area                  --transform->     workspace-area
;;;     loose-visible-workspace-area  <-transform--           "
;;;                                                plus  frame-indent
;;;                                                      image-area

;;; The `workspace-area' may not be entirely visible within the pane.  The
;;; `workspace-area-within-pane' is the `workspace-area' clipped by the pane
;;; `edge-of-pane'
;;;    *-edge-of-workspace-area-within-pane -- a macro

;;; Image planes maybe occluded by the pane boundries and other image-planes in
;;; the stack of image-planes.  The union of the unoccluded portions of the
;;; `image-in-window' are recorded in the slot `visible-region-of-image-plane.'
;;; Drawing an image-plane from scratch requires refreshing each one of
;;; rectangles that together make up this region.

;;; Each rectangle is drawn by:
;;;  1. Drawing the frame (including the background aka the paper).
;;;     guided by the slot `frame-style-reference-of-image-plane'.
;;;  2. Drawing the workspace 
;;;     guided by the `subblocks' of the our workspace.
;;;  3. Drawing any overlay'd image-plane cursors, and finally
;;;     guided by the slot `image-plane-cursors'
;;;  4. Drawing any overlay'd pane cursors.
;;;     guided by the slot `pane-cursors' in our pane.

;;; Since drawing an entire image-plane may take longer than a single micro
;;; task is allowed to take we can suspend drawing.  The record of pending
;;; drawing is maintained in the slot `image-plane-drawing-schedule'.  Drawing
;;; schedules are documented in the section "drawing schedules" below.

;;; An image-plane maybe "coupled" with another so that movements in one of
;;; them creates synchronized movements in the coupled image-plane.  Both the
;;; relative xy position and the relative layer position of image-planes so
;;; coupled are maintained.  See `fix-up-superplanes-and-subplanes.'  The
;;; relevant slots are `superplane?' and `superplane-coupling?'.
;; Currently used only by edit-in-plane.


;;; Some image-planes are pinned so that they show the entire workspace's
;;; extent.  This is indicated by the flag
;;;     `showing-entire-workspace-p'
;;; this flag effects the behavior of scrolling and scaling operations.

;;; `BEWARE:' You might think that you could define reclaimers for slot values
;;; on image-planes the same as any other structure. Well, you be wrong. Slot
;;; reclaimers on image-planes are never called because image-planes are never
;;; reclaimed, they're "disassociated". So you must add explicit calls to slot

;;;; Image-plane Serial Nnumbers



;;; `Image-plane-serial-numbers' are used to detect that an image-plane has been
;;; recycled.  When a workspace is associated with an image-plane a fixnum is
;;; given to the image-plane, the fixnum is set to zero when the image-plane is
;;; disassociated.  By checking that the number of an image-plane has remained
;;; unchanged a data structure can guard a pointer to an image-plane against
;;; recycling the image-plane.

;;; These are like `frame-serial-numbers' except that we treat the fixnums as a
;;; ring, and just go around and around; skipping zero of course.  This has the
;;; advantage that we can not exaust the set of serial numbers, but the
;;; disadvanges is that two image-planes may have the same serial number, and
;;; you can not guard a set of image-planes by storing only a single number.

;;; The primary interface to this is `image-plane-has-not-been-reprocessed-p'
;;; and the slot `serial-number-of-image-plane' in the image-plane.  The
;;; principle customer of this facility is the `valid-workstation-context'

;;;; Frame Transforms


;;; Frame Transforms are used to hold the transformation matrix and frame thru
;;; which a block is rendered, i.e. to do scrolling.

;;; A frame transform is a linkage between an block, an image-plane, and
;;; frame-description-reference.  They are one of the bridges between the window
;;; and KB hierarchy.  Each of these linkages has memory management issues.

;;; The frame-transform <-> image-plane is managed via an unordered double
;;; linked threaded list thru the frame-transforms which hangs from the
;;; frame-transforms-of-blocks-in-image-plane of the image-plane.

;;; The frame-transform -> frame-description-reference is managed as one
;;; reference counted pointer into the frame-description-reference.

;;; The frame-transform <-> block is managed via an alist in the block key'd by
;;; the image-plane, and a pointer in the frame-transform back to the block.

;;; These relationships are established by make-frame-transform, and undone by
;;; reclaim-frame-transform.  That is called by the reclaimers for: the slot in
;;; blocks, the slot in image-planes, as well as by the code that removes an
;;; workspace from an image-plane.

;; Currently these are not used for the workspace blocks, which is way sad.

;;;; Maintaining Visible Regions



;;; The principle algorithm of this section is a recursive walk down the stack
;;; of image-planes, adding or subtracting from the visible region of each
;;; image-plane encountered.  For simplicity we will only discuss the expose
;;; case.  The recursion takes a rectangle being exposed.  It searchs down
;;; until it finds an image-plane overlapping that rectangle.  Failing to find
;;; any such rectangle it adds the exposed rectangle to the pane's visible
;;; region.

;;; Finding an overlapping image-plane it adds the overlap to the visible region
;;; of the image-plane, and then takes the remaininder (up to four new
;;; rectangles, and recurse with them on the remaining stack.

;;; The external routines of this section are:
;;;   recompute-visible-regions-for-workstation
;;;   expose-rectangle-behind-image-plane
;;;   hide-rectangle-behind-image-plane

;;; `Expose-rectangle-over-some-image-planes' takes a newly exposed area and
;;; some tail of the current-pane's stack of image-planes.  It adds the
;;; rectangle to the image-planes and pane it overlaps.  This is called when
;;; any image-plane ocupies some screen real estate.

;;; This routine is internal to this section.  It assumes current-image-plane is
;;; bound.  It assumes this area is not obscured by of the pane's image-planes
;;; not in this list See section introduction for additional info.

;;;; Drawing On A Particular Image Plane

;; Fix documentation for changes and to include refreshing-from-image-plane and
;; for-image-plane!!!




;;; `Drawing' refers to the drawing or erasing of images of workspace elements
;;; on the current image plane, insofar as they fit within that portion of the
;;; workspace area of image-plane-with-image, if any, that is within the pane.

;;; This section introduces the name dynamic extents required to do drawing to a
;;; particular image-plane.  These all require that an on-window-with-drawing
;;; extent has been established.  On-window-with-drawing provides sufficent
;;; context for extremely simple drawing, for example the drawing the "paper"
;;; (i.e.  the pane and image-plane backgrounds and borders.

;;; `Simple-for-image-plane' provides sufficent context to enable refreshing
;;; from graphic element memory.  `For-image-plane' provides sufficent context
;;; for workspace drawing and is used for most drawing in G2.

;;; The act of establishing both an on-window-with-drawing context and then
;;; immediately a for-image-plane context is known as going "on image-plane" and
;;; the macro on-image-plane is provided for establishing both in one fell
;;; swoop.  The term "on-image-plane" is used in two slightly different ways.
;;; First to describe the execution time act of establishing the dynamic extent
;;; necessary to draw a something that resides in a workspace on one of the
;;; image-planes showing that workspace.

;;; Secondly it is used to describe the structural relationship between an
;;; image-plane and the workspace, i.e.  a workspace is said to be "on an
;;; image-plane." The image-plane has a workspace-on-image-plane slot and
;;; meanwhile the workspace has an image-planes-this-is-on slot.

;;; Recall that it is illegal to recursively enter on-window, since ICP message
;;; groups don't nest.

;;; Bear in mind that both on-window-with-drawing and on-image-plane are
;;; expensive both lexically and dynamicly.

;;; Any color differences passed to drawing primitives should be identical
;;; to those implied by the fore and background color bindings.  Individual
;;; block draw methods will rebind these as approprate.

;;; Most of these are part of the for-image-plane context, but current-{fore,
;;; back}ground-color-value and current-drawing-transfer-mode are part of the
;;; on-window-without-drawing dynamic-extent.

;;; The `current-frame-transform?', if any, is the frame transform of that is
;;; enclosing the current rendering.  This binding allows draw-block methods to
;;; check if the frame transform they require has been established and if not to
;;; establish it.  That, in turn, enables them to be called recursively from a
;;; parent (that presumbably would establish the transform) and directly (when
;;; it wouldn't be established).
;;; You should also see the doc for block-is-currently-being-dragged-p
;;; since it usually that effects the behavior of the block draw methods.
;;; By convention most block draw methods establish a lexical binding for
;;; suppress-details?  so that the block is drawn differently at a small

;; If we had an extent for drawing a block independent of image-plane,

;;; The primary clipping rectangle is established in `left-edge-of-draw-area',
;;; `top-edge-of-draw-area', `right-edge-of-draw-area', and
;;; `bottom-edge-of-draw-area'.  These are known as the `draw-area'.
;;; These are part of the basic-on-window context.

;;; Draw areas nest.  The entire window is broken into panes.  The panes have
;;; image-planes.  The image-planes are parititoned into exposed rectangular
;;; regions.  Meanwhile the image-planes have frames, inside of band of the
;;; frame is a workspace area.  The workspace area has blocks and connections
;;; in it.  The blocks have extent (aka extreme-edges).  The blocks have
;;; edges.  The blocks have subblocks (that need not lie within their edges).
;;; The blocks have nested components (cells in tables for example).
;;; Incremental updates to blocks sometimes focus the draw area on components
;;; or even portions of the components (portions of the text for example).

;;; The exposed region of an image plane, which might not be a rectangle, is
;;; drawn one or more times until the union of these draw-areas covers the
;;; entire exposed area of the image-plane.  Of course these are in raster
;;; units, see the section on quick clipping for a similar but not identical set
;;; rectangle in workspace units.

;;; Individual draw methods may rebind these values to tighten the draw
;;; area, both to assure that drawing is limited to the bounds of the
;;; block, or to limit drawing just to the areas being changed.

;;; Two examples taken from text drawing.  In freeform tables this is
;;; used to clip the user's text to the bounds of the table cells.  In
;;; all (?) incremental text updating this is used to limit redrawing,
;;; for example if "Temp of tank 12: 32 degrees" becomes "Temp of tank
;;; 12: 33 degrees" we attempt to draw only the portion "33 degrees"

;;; The mapping from a workspace clipping rectangle into an
;;; image-plane clipping rectangle is very delicate.  First there is a
;;; flaw in the design of icons.  Second is a generic problem in
;;; scalling.

;;; A icon that is recorded as 20 pixels wide is actually 21 pixel's
;;; wide.  The routines that compute the 'extreme edges' of portions
;;; of the subblock connection hierarchy add in this additional
;;; padding.  It would be wrong to circumvent those routines.

;;; At small scales objects may `bleed' outside the right or bottom of the
;;; the draw area.  Part of the reason for this arises from the pen's
;;; behavor of hanging down and to the right.  The primary reason arises
;;; because if a graphic's width scales down to zero then the draw code
;;; may decide to increment the width back up to one to get ink on the
;;; page.  When the graphic is on the right or botttom edge then it
;;; will bleed outside clipping area implied by a simple mapping of the
;;; workspace clipping area into the image plane clipping area.

;;; This is sometimes called `bleeding at low scales', and it is handled
;;; by a `bleeding-hack' parameter to the routines that do this mapping.

;;; The work around is not pretty.  When mapping a workspace clipping
;;; rectangle into the image-plane clipping rectangle a one pixel hack
;;; is added on the right and left when rendering at less then full
;;; scale.  This is the default behavor.

;;; The work around can be adjusted in two ways.  The routines that
;;; do this work around take a flag to adjust it.  In some cases it
;;; is possible to skip it, this is done when rendering text, since
;;; those bitmaps are scalled so as not to bleed.  In some cases it
;;; is possible to bleed to the left or top, for example when enlarge
;;; the right edge of the text box.  In that case the clipping
;;; rectangle is bought right up against the inside edge of the border,
;;; after scaling the border maybe drawn one pixel to the left of that
;;; hence bleeding outside the clipping area.

;;; The flag controlling the `bleeding-hack' may have one of four possible values:
;;; `:no-bleeding'              -- no bleeding
;;; `nil'                       -- bleeding on the right and bottom
;;; `:bleeding-on-all-sides'.'  -- bleeding on left, top, right, and bottom.
;;       This one bleeds at large-scale, too. Used only by text-box borders.
;;; `:connection-bleeding'      -- bleeding on all sides by 2 pixels at reduced scales

;; The precise semantics of the bleeding-hack are defined by the macro
;; with-workspace-to-window-transform.

;;; The work around can cause flickering.  Text drawing, for example, never
;;; bleeds at low scales since the character rectangles don't ever scale down
;;; to zero width.  The routines that do the mapping from workspace clipping to
;;; image-plane clipping therefore all take a flag to supress this bleeding
;;; hack.

;; The metacolors workspace-foreground and background are obsolete!

;; The idea of the above two macros is that the metacolor buck stops with
;; the workspace foreground/background colors.  And if the background color is
;; defined in terms of the foreground color, the foreground color can't turn
;; around and be defined in terms of the background color.  So,
;;
;;  (1) If the foreground color is FOREGROUND, your foreground color is BLACK
;;
;;  (2) If the background color is TRANSPARENT, your background color is WHITE
;;
;;  (3) if the background color is FOREGROUND, and the foreground color is
;;      FOREGROUND, your background color is BLACK
;;
;;  (4) if the background color is FOREGROUND, and the foreground color is
;;      TRANSPARENT, your background color is WHITE (circular case)
;;
;;  (5) if the foreground color is TRANSPARENT, and the background color is

;; Really, the original goal was to never allow metacolors in the workspace
;; color regions, but it's too late for that, since actions have been allowing
;; them for a while (although the menus don't put them in).  You could maybe go

;;;; Drawing Schedules and drawing tasks



;;; A `drawing-schedule' is a queue of drawing tasks which need to be taken to
;;; get a pane or image-plane up-to-date.  These actions maybe deferred in G2
;;; to allow other micro tasks to run.

;;; Drawing schedules are stored in the {pane,image-plane}-drawing-schedule
;;; slots of panes and image-planes respectively.  The drawing schedule
;;; is a graphics list.  The individual drawing tasks are instances of
;;; the structure drawing-task.

;;; It is a small problem that drawing schedules appear on both
;;; image-planes and panes.  For example the dynamic extent required
;;; to draw in a pane is very different than that of an image-plane.
;;; That usually means that drawing tasks appropriate for an image-plane
;;; are not approprate for a pane.

;;; These are the currently implemented drawing tasks:
;;;  refresh-region-of-image-plane
;;;  refresh-region-of-block
;;;  refresh-color-of-block
;;;  refresh-region-of-pane

;;; All coordinates in drawing tasks are given in window coordinates.
;;; Transform-image-plane must fixup existing drawing tasks.  The drawing tasks
;;; often attempt to draw things that are entirely obscured in the current
;;; image-plane.  Individual drawing tasks must clip approprately.

;;; To enable an efficent implementation of the predicate: "Is there any drawing
;;; pending on this window?" we maintain a counter `count-of-enqueued-drawing'
;;; in every gensym-window.  This counter is incremented when new drawing tasks
;;; are consed and decremented when they are reclaimed.

(def-concept drawing-schedule)


;;; The variable `working-on-drawing-schedule' is bound to T during the dynamic
;;; extent of work-on-drawing-schedule. Certain mutations of the schedule are
;;; not allowed while we are working on it, namely, you are not allowed to
;;; delete the head of the queue.
