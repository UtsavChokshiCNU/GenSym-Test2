<h1>Custom and Embedded Environments</h1>
<p>
This topic does not apply to embedded systems running POSIX/Unix compliant operating systems such as Linux.
For instructions to build the run-time for such systems, see <a href=env-unix.html>Unix</a>.

<h2><a name=1></a>CPU Support</h2>
<p>
BullseyeCoverage can support any CPU with a size of <code>int</code> of 32-bits or more.
<h2><a name=2></a>Compiler Support</h2>
<p>
BullseyeCoverage must have support for your specific compiler regardless of how
well the compiler conforms to standards.
This is because all compilers have extensions and
the standards do not cover command line option syntax.
<p>
For a full list of supported embedded system compilers, see
<a href="http://www.bullseye.com/platform.html">BullseyeCoverage Platform Support</a>.
If your compiler is not yet supported,
contact <a href="http://www.bullseye.com/support.html">Technical Support</a>
so that we can determine whether we can add support for your compiler.
<h2><a name=3></a>Core Run-time Functions</h2>
<p>
The functions listed below support the operation of the run-time library.
They are already implemented for many platforms, provided in the <code>run</code> subdirectory.
Otherwise, you must provide working implementations.
<ul>
<li>
<code>open</code>
<p>
This function must be defined according to the Open Group Single UNIX Specification for
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/open.html">open</a>,
except the run-time uses only the arguments shown below.
<pre>
open(<i>path</i>, O_RDONLY, 0)
open(<i>path</i>, O_RDWR, 0)
open(<i>path</i>, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR)
</pre>
<p>
<li>
<code>write</code>
<p>
This function must be defined according to the Open Group Single UNIX Specification for
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/write.html">write</a>.
<pre>
write(<i>fildes</i>, <i>buf</i>, <i>nbyte</i>)
</pre>
The run-time reports errors by calling <code>write</code> with file descriptor 2
(the value of <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/unistd.h.html">STDERR_FILENO</a>).
<pre>
write(2, <i>errorMessage</i>, <i>errorMessageLength</i>)
</pre>
<p>
<li>
<code>close</code>,
<code>read</code>,
<code>lseek</code>
<p>
These functions must be defined according to the Open Group Single UNIX Specification for

<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/read.html">read</a>,
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/lseek.html">lseek</a>.
<p>
<li>
<code>cov_atomic_tryLock</code>,
<code>cov_atomic_unlock</code>
<p>
The run-time uses these functions to synchronize multiple threads.
They are defined in <code>run/atomic.h</code>.
This source already supports many compiler/CPU combinations.
</ul>
<h2><a name=4></a>Optional Run-time Functions</h2>
<p>
The functions listed below must be defined,
however they can remain stubbed as provided in the source file
<code>run/libcov-user.c</code>.
<ul>
<li>
<code>atexit</code>
<p>
The run-time uses this function to save coverage upon program termination.
See the Open Group Single UNIX Specification for
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/atexit.html">atexit</a>.
<p>
<li>
<code>fcntl</code>
<p>
The run-time uses this function to synchronize access to the coverage file among multiple threads and processes.
See the Open Group Single UNIX Specification for
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fcntl.html">fcntl</a>.
The run-time uses only the arguments shown below.
<pre>
fcntl(<i>fildes</i>, F_SETLKW, <i>arg</i>)
</pre>
<p>

<p>
<li>
<code>nanosleep</code>,
<code>pthread_create</code>,
<code>pthread_exit</code>,
<code>pthread_join</code>
<p>
The run-time uses these functions to automatically save coverage periodically.
See the Open Group Single UNIX Specification for
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/nanosleep.html">nanosleep</a>,
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_create.html">pthread_create</a>,

<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_join.html">pthread_join</a>.
</ul>
<h2><a name=5></a>File I/O Implementation Requirements</h2>
<p>
The BullseyeCoverage run-time both reads and writes the coverage file, which is
created during the build process.
The BullseyeCoverage run-time requires access to the entire coverage file.
The size of the coverage file is proportional to the size of the test program.
You can estimate the size of the coverage file by compiling a test
program, or the sample programs supplied with BullseyeCoverage.
The number of bytes read or written in each operation varies from 1 to 512 bytes.
The BullseyeCoverage run-time updates the coverage file when the test program calls
<a href=ref_cov_write.html>cov_write</a>.
This function updates the information which has changed since the last call.
If no coverage has changed, no file i/o activity occurs.
The coverage file format is extremely complex, subject to frequent
change, and therefore undocumented.
<p>
One possible design which meets these requirements is to
have <code>open</code> download the coverage file from the host system
into the embedded system memory via a serial port or network card and
<code>close</code> upload the file back to the host system.
Then <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>lseek</code> can
access the file directly and quickly in memory.
<p>
Another possible design is for each i/o function to forward the request
to the host system; transferring data when needed.
<p>
The size of data transferred is difficult to predict but here is an estimate.
Each call to <code>cov_write</code> transfers data in both directions in
blocks ranging in size from 1 to 512 bytes.
Typically there are a number of small downloads on the order of 4-8 bytes.
The number of these is a multiple of the number of object files in your program.
Interspersed will be fewer, bigger downloads and uploads ranging from
100 to 512 bytes, proportional to the size of your object files.
BullseyeCoverage only transfers the larger blocks when some coverage info changes
so in general you should see a decrease in activity with each call to
<code>cov_write</code> as time goes on.
If you call <code>cov_write</code> just once at program end, you should expect the total data
transfer approximately equal to the size of the coverage file, in both
directions.
<h2><a name=6></a>Memory Requirements</h2>
<p>
Code size generally increases by about 1.4x.
The increase varies, depending on the compiler brand, compiler optimization settings, and CPU architecture.
<p>
The run-time library occupies approximately 3KB code and 5KB data compiled with GCC for x86.
For each source file instrumented, BullseyeCoverage adds a data structure in
memory about 32 bytes plus one byte for each probe in that source file.
Each probe corresponds to a function entry, condition, decision, switch
label or exception handler.
<h2><a name=7></a>Porting Procedure</h2>
<p>
These steps describe how to port the BullseyeCoverage run-time to a new environment.
Keep us apprised of your progress to reduce the risk of back tracking due to
misunderstanding the run-time requirements.
Read all these steps before beginning work.
<ol>
<li>
Enable <a href=build_coverageBuild.html>Coverage Build</a>
and verify your build procedure invokes BullseyeCoverage.
You should see the banner shown below in your build log each time the compiler is invoked.
<pre>
BullseyeCoverage Compile C++ <i>version platform</i>
Copyright (c) Bullseye Testing Technology 1990-<i>year</i>
</pre>
<p>
If you do not see the banner,
see <a href=trouble_coverageBuild.html>Coverage Build Does Not Take Effect </a> or
contact us.
<p>
It is normal to see link errors at this step.
After you compile, <a href=index_report.html>look at a coverage report</a>.
The measurements show all 0%, but you see what will be measured.
<p>
<li>
Build the BullseyeCoverage run-time
user-defined platform source file <code>run/libcov-user.c</code>,
which contains stubs for all functions.
<p>
If you see an error in <code>run/atomic-user.h</code> (due to a <code>#error</code> directive),
then the functions in that source file need implementation now.
See the comments in that file.
Contact us for assistance.
<p>
You should see no compile errors before moving on.
<p>
<li>
Link a test program with the library created in the previous step.
You should see no link errors before moving on.
<p>
<li>
Modify <code>run/libcov-user.c</code> to implement the core functions described above.
The first and most important function to implement is <code>write(2,<i>buf</i>,<i>nbyte</i>)</code>,
which displays error messages.
By implementing this function first,
you can more easily diagnose problems with the other function implementations.
After implementing the core functions, then implement any optional functions that are feasible.
<p>
Iteratively re-link and run your test program to try out your changes.  When the
coverage reports show all expected measurements and you get no run-time errors,
your port is complete.
<p>
Linking does not change the coverage file.
You only need to download the coverage file after compiling the test program.
<p>
<li>
Send us your changes to <code>run/libcov-user.c</code>.
We will inspect your code and verify that it complies with our run-time requirements.
We can incorporate your code into our release distribution so that you do not
need to apply patches when you receive updates.
By maintaining your port in our distribution, we can take your run-time
requirements into consideration when we make architectural changes in the
future.
</ol>
<h2><a name=8></a>Build Options</h2>
<p>
The macro settings listed below select optional run-time configurations.
<table border=1>
<tr><td>
<code>-DLibcov_covfile=\"<i>path</i>\"</code>
<td>
If environment variable <code>COVFILE</code> is not set or if <code>getenv</code> is not available,
look for the coverage file at <i>path</i>.
