<h1>
Measuring a Library
</h1>
<P>
Sometimes you want to measure coverage of a library but you
have little or no interest in measuring coverage of the driver
program(s) used to test the library.
There are three alternatives described below.
With both of these alternatives, just one coverage file is used.
No environment variables need adjustment and no BullseyeCoverage library calls
are needed.
<h2>Selecting the Library in the Coverage Browser</h2>
<p>
This alternative is the easiest, by far.
<p>
Build the library as well as the driver program.
Immediately after building, run the
<a href=coverageBrowser.html>Coverage Browser</a>.
Use the menu command <code>Region Exclude</code> to exclude the driver program.
Measurements for the driver program no longer appear.
If you choose to build again, no probes are added to the excluded source code.
<h2>Selecting the Library Source with covc
</H2>
<P>
If your library source is located in a separate directory, for
example named <CODE>library</CODE>, you can measure coverage of
only that source by specifying covc option <CODE>-tlibrary/</CODE>
(<CODE>--select library/</CODE>). This alternative completely
excludes the driver program source code and reports only measurements
for the library.
<P>
For example, run the command below before building.
<PRE>
echo -tlibrary/ &gt;<i>BullseyeCoverage</i>/bin/covc.cfg
</PRE>
<P>
If you have multiple libraries, you can specify all of them at
once. For example, if you have library source located in directories
<CODE>dir1</CODE>, <CODE>dir2</CODE>, and <CODE>dir3</CODE>.
<PRE>
echo -tdir1/,dir2/,dir3/ &gt;<i>BullseyeCoverage</i>/bin/covc.cfg
</PRE>
<h2>Selecting the Library Source at Report-time from the Command Prompt
</H2>
<p>
If you sometimes want coverage measurements for the driver program(s)
as well as the library, you can measure all source code then create
reports for all the source or for just the library source. Suppose
your library source is located in a directory named <CODE>library</CODE>
and your driver program is located in a directory named <CODE>driver</CODE>.
You can see a report for the library using the command line region
<CODE>library/</CODE>. For example,
<PRE>
covsrc library/
</PRE>
<P>
You can see a report for the driver program using the command
line region <CODE>driver/</CODE>. For example,
<PRE>
covsrc driver/
</PRE>
<P>
You can see a report for all source by simply omitting any command
line regions.
<P>
If you wish to discard measurements the driver program, use <a href=ref_covmgr.html>covmgr</a>
option <CODE>-r</CODE> (<CODE>--remove</CODE>). For example,
<PRE>
covmgr -r driver/
</PRE>
