Introduction
</h1>
<h2>
<a name=1></a>
What is BullseyeCoverage</h2>
<P>
BullseyeCoverage is a code coverage analyzer for programs written in the
C and C++ languages. With BullseyeCoverage, you can:
<UL>
<LI>identify code which was not fully exercised during testing
<LI>obtain summary measurements of testing completeness to help
you decide when you have tested enough
</UL>
<P>
The steps involved in using BullseyeCoverage are:
<OL>
<LI>Enable <a href=build_coverageBuild.html>Coverage Build</a>
and build your program
<LI>Run your program one or more times
<LI>Generate and view <a href=report.html>coverage reports</a>
<LI>Repeat from step 2 until you are satisfied with testing
</OL>
<p>
<h2><a name=5></a>How it Works</h2>
<p>
When you compile code with BullseyeCoverage enabled, information about the code is written to a <i>coverage file</i>.
The BullseyeCoverage run-time library collects coverage measurements in memory and
periodically writes this data to the same coverage file.
Environment variable <code>COVFILE</code> names the coverage file.
You can view the coverage file using the
<a href=coverageBrowser.html>Coverage Browser</a>
or the
<a href=report.html>command line report programs</a>.

Measurement Technique</h2>
<P>
BullseyeCoverage is an intrusive coverage analyzer; it adds probes to C and C++ source
code.
There is no measurement of assembly code.
BullseyeCoverage measures condition/decision coverage and function
coverage. A short description of these measures is given below.
A detailed description of these measures, and others, is included
in
<a href="http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html">http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html</a>.
<P>
BullseyeCoverage measures condition/decision coverage by default. This
measure reports the following information.
<OL>
<li>whether each controlling expression in <code>if</code>,
<CODE>if</CODE>-<CODE>else</CODE>, <CODE>while</CODE>, <CODE>do</CODE>-<CODE>while</CODE>,
and <code>for</code> statements evaluates to both true and false
<li>whether each sub-expression separated by logical-and (<code>&&</code>)
and logical-or (<CODE>||</CODE>), evaluates to both true and false.
<li>whether the controlling expression in each conditional-expression (<code>?:</code>) that does not occur inside another controlling expression evaluates to both true and false,
<LI>whether each <CODE>switch</CODE> label is selected
<LI>whether each function is invoked
<LI>whether each C++ <CODE>catch</CODE> clause is entered
<li>whether control reached the end of each C++ try-block
</OL>

Performance</h2>
<p>
Instrumenting with BullseyeCoverage typically increases
execution time to 1.2x,
code size to 1.4x and
compile time to 1.7x with most Microsoft C++ projects, 3-8x with other compilers. 
Your results may vary.
Compiler optimization settings greatly affect performance of instrumented code.
<h2>

Typographical Conventions</h2>
<P>
Text in <CODE>code font</CODE> indicates text literally as it
appears in a program or in a command. Text in <i>italic font</i>
indicates a place holder for text that varies or that you supply.
Text that appears within square brackets [ ] is optional.
<P>
The word <i>BullseyeCoverage</i> (italic) refers to the directory
where you install BullseyeCoverage.
<P>
For Windows, we sometimes show
the directory separator character as a forward slash <CODE>/</CODE>
instead of the more conventional backslash <CODE>\</CODE>. This
is for simplicity since BullseyeCoverage accepts the forward slash <CODE>/</CODE>
as the directory separator on all operating systems.
