INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNITY
<ol><li>
Bullseye Testing Technology shall indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any claim by a third party that the Software infringes any patent, trade secret,  copyright or other intellectual property right of that third party, provided:  (i) Bullseye Testing Technology is promptly notified of the claim; (ii) Bullseye Testing Technology receives reasonable cooperation from Licensee in protecting its rights related thereto; and (iii) Bullseye Testing Technology has the opportunity to assume sole control over the defense and all negotiations for a settlement or compromise.
