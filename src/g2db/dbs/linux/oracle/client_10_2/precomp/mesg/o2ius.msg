101,0,   "Invalid value for the USERID parameter"
// *Cause: The value supplied for the USERID parameter is not a legal
// <username>/<password>[@<databasename>] string.
// *Action: Set the USERID option to the correct <username>/<password> or
//  <username>/<password>@<database name> combination to use when connecting
//  to the database.  If you have an OPS$ account, you may instead omit the
//  USERID option, in which case OTT will attempt to connect to the
//  database using the userid OPS$<username>.  The USERID option may be
//  specified on the command line or in a CONFIG file.
102,0,   "Unable to connect to Oracle"
// *Cause: OTT could not connect to Oracle with the username, password, and,
//  if applicable, database link that was supplied.  Either the USERID
//  option value was incorrect, or, if the USERID was not supplied, the
//  userid OPS$<username> was not accepted.
// *Action: Check that the username and password are current and correct.
//  Run another program that connects to Oracle to verify that you can connect using
//  that username and password.
103,0,   "Two file names refer to the same HFILE file in the INTYPE file"
// *Cause: Two different file names have been used in the INTYPE file to
// refer to the same HFILE file, or different file names have been used to
// refer to the same HFILE file on the command line and in the INTYPE file.
// *Action: Consistently refer to each HFILE file using the same file name.
110,0,   "Internal error in OTT component O2I"
// *Cause: An internal OTT error occurred in the O2I component of OTT.
// *Action: Contact ORACLE customer support.
111,0,   "Unable to allocate memory"
// *Cause: OTT was unable to allocate memory.
// *Action: Contact ORACLE customer support.
112,0,   "Unable to write to the HFILE file"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred when attempting to write to
//  the HFILE file.
// *Action: Make sure you have operating system permission to write to the
//  file.  Also, make sure disk space is available.
113,0,   "No HFILE specified"
// *Cause: The HFILE file to which C declarations generated by OTT are written
//  was not specified.
// *Action: Specify the global HFILE option on the command line or in a
//  CONFIG file.  You may choose a different HFILE for a particular type
//  by specifying a different HFILE in the INTYPE file entry describing the
//  type.  If every INTYPE file entry specifies an HFILE, and if none of the
//  types in the HFILE require declarations of types not mentioned there,
//  the global HFILE option may be omitted.  An INTYPE file generated
//  by a previous invocation of OTT satisfies these conditions.
114,0,   "Invalid HFILE file name"
// *Cause: An HFILE file name was specified that is not syntactically
//  correct.
// *Action: Make sure the HFILE filename is spelled correctly.
115,0,   "Error opening the HFILE file"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred while attempting to open the
//  HFILE file for writing.
// *Action: Make sure the HFILE filename is spelled correctly.  Try
//  creating or modifying the HFILE to make sure you have write access
//  to the file.
116,0,   "Unable to close the HFILE file"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred while attempting to close the
//  HFILE file.
// *Action: Try creating or modifying the HFILE file to make sure you
//  are able to access the file.
117,0,   "Internal error: No message file for component O2U"
// *Cause: The message file for the internal OTT component O2U was not
//  found.  OTT may not be correctly installed.
// *Action: Contact ORACLE customer support.
118,0,   "This user-defined type was not found in the database"
// *Cause: A user-defined type specified in the INTYPE file was not found
//  in the database.
// *Action: Make sure the name of the type is spelled correctly.  Make
//  sure the type is actually declared in the database.
119,0,   "Warning reported by subsystem:\n    "
// *Cause: A subsystem invoked by OTT reported a warning.  This warning
//  immediately follows the "Warning reported by subsystem" message.
// *Action: Examine the warning reported by the subsystem to determine
//  its cause.
120,0,   "Error reported by subsystem:\n    "
// *Cause: A subsystem invoked by OTT reported an error.  This error
//  immediately follows the "Error reported by subsystem" message.
// *Action: Examine the error message reported by the sybsystem to
//  determine its cause.
121,0,   "No value was specified for the CODE option"
// *Cause: The required CODE option was not specified on the command
//  line or in a configuration file. 
// *Action: Specify the CODE option on the command line or in a
//  configuration file.  Currently, the following values of the CODE
//  option are supported: CODE=ANSI_C, CODE=KR_C, CODE=C
122,0,   "Invalid filename for the INITFILE file"
// *Cause: The filename specified for the INITFILE file is not syntactically
//  correct.
// *Action: Make sure the filename of the INITFILE file is spelled correctly.
123,0,   "Unable to close the INITFILE file"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred while attempting to close the
//  INITFILE file.
// *Action: Try opening the INITFILE file with an editor to make sure
//  the file can be accessed.
124,0,   "Error opening the INITFILE file for writing"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred while attempting to open the
//  INITFILE file for writing.
// *Action: Make sure the INITFILE filename is spelled correctly.  Try
//  creating or modifying the INITFILE file to make sure you have write access
//  to the file.
125,0, "Error writing to the INITFILE file"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred when attempting to write to
//  the INITFILE file.
// *Action: Make sure you have operating system permission to write to the
//  file.  Also, make sure disk space is available.
126,0, "You must specify an INTYPE file with SCHEMA_NAMES=FROM_INTYPE"
// *Cause: The option SCHEMA_NAMES=FROM_INTYPE requests that schema
//  names be written to the OUTTYPE file as given in the INTYPE file.
//  However, an INTYPE file was not specified.
// *Action: Either supply the name of an INTYPE file, or specify the
//  SCHEMA_NAMES option ALWAYS or IF_NEEDED.
127,0, "Illegal INITFUNC name"
//  *Cause: The name of the INITFUNC function is not a legal C or C++
//  identifier.
//  *Action:  Specify the name of the INITFUNC function as a legal C or C++
//  identifier.  This name may be given in the INTYPE file, given on the
//  command line, or derived from the INITFILE name.
128,0,  "Unable to write to the Java file"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred when attempting to write to
//  a Java source file.
// *Action: Make sure you have operating system permission to write to the
//  file.  Also, make sure disk space is available.
129,0,   "No Java file specified"
// *Cause: The file to which Java declarations generated by OTT are written
//  was not specified.
// *Action: This message should never be seen, because Java files are named
//  after the classes declared within them.  Contact ORACLE customer support.
130,0,   "Invalid Java file name"
// *Cause: A Java file name was specified that is not syntactically
//  correct.
// *Action: Make sure the Java filename is spelled correctly.
131,0,   "Error opening a Java file"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred while attempting to open a
//  Java file for writing.
// *Action: Make sure the filename is spelled correctly.  Try
//  creating or modifying the file to make sure you have write access
//  to the file.
132,0,   "Unable to close a Java file"
// *Cause: An operating system error occurred while attempting to close a
//  Java file.
// *Action: Try creating or modifying the Java file to make sure you
//  are able to access the file.
133, 0, "An error occurred for which no message is available"
//  *Cause: The cause of this error was not reported.
//  *Action: Contact ORACLE customer support.
