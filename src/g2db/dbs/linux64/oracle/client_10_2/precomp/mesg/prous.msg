/
/       TRANSLATION DOCUMENTATION:
/
/  The following messages are broken down into the following categories:
/
/      1 - 1999: PRO* Error messages.  These should be translated with some
/        exceptions where a keyword, command line option name or value, or
/        something similar is mentioned.
/
/   2000 - 2099: "Fixed" strings.  DO NOT TRANSLATE.  These are command line
/        line option names and values, keywords, etc.  There are a few things
/        here which *can* be translated.  These are marked with "T...T".
/
/   2100 - 2299: Other "fixed" strings.  Most of these are explanatory text
/        for the old PRO* "help" screen.  These can in general be translated 
/        except where command line option names or values, etc. are mentioned.
/
/   4200 - 4299: Explanatory text for the PRO* help screen for the current
/        release of PRO*. These should be translated except where option names,
/        values, etc. are mentioned. Words which should not be translated are
/        marked with "*....*".
/
/  Restrictions on translations:
/
/   1)  Format strings such as "%s", "%u", etc. are *not* translated.
/
/   2)  Most of the error messages (1-1999) are used as C language format
/       strings and use C formatting (%s, %u, %d, etc.).  The relative
/       order of the formats (%s, etc.) within a particular error message
/       and the phrases that contain them CANNOT be changed without
/       possibly causing a precompiler abort or incorrect information in
/       the error message.  For instance, consider error message #1 --
/       the translation for "at column %u" must be before the translation
/       for "in line %u" which must be before the translation for
/       "of file %s".  The same situation applies to messages 2100 to 2299.
/
/   3)  Many of the individual words in the messages 1-1999, 2100-2299, 4200+
/       are host language keywords, SQL keywords, PRO* command line option names
/       and values and should *not* be translated.  These individual words
/       have "*"s underneath them.
/
/   4)  Some terminology is computer language terminology, such as "Area A"
/       for COBOL, that I am not sure whether or not it is translated.  The
/       best thing to do here is to get an American version of a compiler
/       manual for the particular computer language to find out what the
/       term refers to and then to look in a foreign language version of a
/       manual for the computer language to see how it is translated.  These
/       are marked with "L...L".
/
/   5)  Some terms, such as "bind" and "define", are Oracle terms that I do
/       not know if they are translated.  These terms are not marked in
/       any way.  The translator should be generally familiar with the
/       Oracle terminology for the language being translated to.
/
/   You will see these marks BELOW the word to be marked.
/   ***** - Do not translate this part of otherwise translated text.
/   TTTTT - Translate this part of otherwise untranslated text.
/   LLLLL - Computer language terminology, look in appropriate computer
/             language manuals for translations.

/	PRO* Error Messages.
/
// NLS Translate except %s,%u, %d, etc or marked with  "***" [0000,1999]
1,0,	"Unable to open file %s"
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to open a temporary file for internal
//         use.  There might be insufficient disk space, too many open files,
//         or read-only protection on the output directory.
// *Action: Check that there is enough disk space, that the limit for open
//          files is set high enough (check with the system manager) and that
//          protection on the directory allows opening a file for writing.
2,0,	"Invalid syntax at column %u in line %u of file %s"
// *Cause: There is a syntax error in an EXEC statement or the statement is
//         not properly terminated.
// *Action: Correct the syntax of the EXEC statement.  If the error occurred
//          at the end of the input file, check that the last EXEC statement
//          is properly terminated.
3,0,	"Invalid SQL Identifier at column %u in line %u of file %s"
/                ***
// *Cause: The symbol in a conditional precompilation statement (such as EXEC
//         ORACLE IFDEF) is invalid, or the name of a SQL descriptor,
//         statement, or cursor is invalid or was not properly declared.
// *Action: Check the statement syntax and spelling of the identifier and
//          check that a reserved word was not accidentally used.  If
//          necessary, define the identifier in a variable declaration or
//          DECLARE statement ahead of the line in error.
4,0,	"Mismatched IF/ELSE/ENDIF block at line %u in file %s"
/                   *************
// *Cause: There is an EXEC ORACLE ELSE or EXEC ORACLE ENDIF statement
//         without a matching EXEC ORACLE IFDEF statement.
// *Action: Add the missing EXEC ORACLE IFDEF statement or deletee or move
//          the EXEC ORACLE ELSE or EXEC ORACLE ENDIF statement.
5,0,	"Unsupported datatype in line %u of file %s"
// *Cause: A host variable defined in the Declare Section has an unsupported
//         datatype or has a scale or precision outside the supported range.
// *Action: Redefine the host variable using a supported datatype.  Check that
//          the scale and precision of a numeric variable are in the accepted
//          range.
7,0,	"Invalid WHENEVER condition at column %u in line %u of file %s"
/                ********
// *Cause: A condition other than SQLERROR, SQLWARNING, or NOT FOUND was
//         specified in an EXEC SQL WHENEVER statement, or one of these was
//         used, but spelled incorrectly.
// *Action: Correct the spelling of the WHENEVER condition or use a host-
//          language IF statement to test the special condition.
8,0,	"Invalid WHENEVER action at column %u in line %u of file %s"
/                ********
// *Cause: At lease one of the following:
//           o An action other than CONTINUE, DO, GOTO, or STOP was specified
//             in an EXEC SQL WHENEVER statement.
//           o One of the specified actions was spelled incorrectly.
//           o The host language does not allow the action (STOP is illegal
//             in Pro*Pascal programs).
//           o A GOTO label is invalid.
// *Action: Check that the host language allows the specified WHENEVER action.
//          If necessary, correct the spelling of the WHENEVER action or
//          correct the GOTO label.
9,0,	"Invalid host variable at column %u in line %u of file %s"
// *Cause: A host variable used in an EXEC SQL statement was not declared in
//         the Declare Section or has an unsupported datatype.
// *Action: Declare the host variable in the Declare Section, making sure it
//          has one of the supported datatypes.
10,0,	"Statement out of place at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: An EXEC statement was not placed properly in the host program.  For
//         example, there might be a data manipulation statement in the
//         Declare Section.  In a Pro*COBOL program, the Declare Section might
//         be outside the WORKING-STORAGE or LINKAGE SECTION.
// *Action: Remove or relocate the statement.
11,0,	"Already in a declare section at line %u in file %s"
/                     ***************
// *Cause: A BEGIN DECLARE SECTION statement was found inside a Declare
//         Section.
// *Action: Remove the extra BEGIN DECLARE SECTION statement.
12,0,	"Not in a declare section at line %u in file %s"
/                 ***************
// *Cause: An END DECLARE SECTION statement without a matching BEGIN DECLARE
//         SECTION statement was found.  Either the BEGIN DECLARE SECTION
//         statement is missing or misspelled or the END DECLARE SECTION
//         statement is an extra.
// *Action: Add or correct the BEGIN DECLARE SECTION statement or remove the
//          extra END DECLARE SECTION statement.
13,0,	"Unable to open include file \"%s\" at line %u in file %s"
/                       *******
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to open the input file specified in the
//         INCLUDE statement.  Some possible causes follow:
//           o The filename is misspelled.
//           o The file does not exist.
//           o The search path to the file is incorrect.
//           o File access privileges are insufficient.
//           o There is not enough disk space.
//           o There are too many open files.
// *Action: Check that the file exists, that the search path to the file is
//          correct, that sufficient privileges to access the file have been
//          granted, and that it is not locked by another user.  Also, check
//          that there is enough disk space and that the limit for open files
//          is set high enough (check with the system manager).
14,0,	"Undeclared SQL Identifier \"%s\" at line %u in file %s"
/                   ***
// *Cause: The name of a descriptor, statement, or cursor was not declared or
//         is misspelled.
// *Action: Add or correct the descriptor, statement, or cursor declaration.
15,0,	"Unrecognized Host Language syntax ignored at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: The host language syntax used to define a host variable in the
//         Declare Section is incorrect.
// *Action: Check the syntax and the spelling, then correct the declaration.
16,0,	"Unable to open a cursor at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: The syntax in a SQL statement is faulty.  The precompiler was
//         expecting a host variable, but found something else.
// *Action: Check the syntax and the spelling, then correct the SQL statement.
17,0,	"Unable to parse statement at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: There is a syntax error in an array declaration.  The precompiler
//         was expecting a right bracket (]) but found something else.
// *Action: Check the syntax, then correct the array declaration.
18,0,	"Expected \"%s\", but found \"%.15s\" at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: The syntax in a SQL statement is faulty.  The precompiler found an
//         unexpected or illegal token.
// *Action: Check the syntax and the spelling, then correct the SQL statement.
19,0,	"Unable to obtain bind variables at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to find information about an input host
//         variable (bind variable) used in a SQL statement.
// *Action: Check that the input host variable is declared in the Declare
//          Section and used properly in the SQL statement.
20,0,	"Unable to obtain define variables at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to find information about an output host
//         variable (define variable) used in a SQL statement.
// *Action: Check that the output host variable is declared in the Declare
//          Section and used properly in the SQL statement.
21,0,	"Oracle Error: %s"
// *Cause: An Oracle error occurred.
// *Action: Refer to the indicated message in the ORA message chapters of 
//        this manual.
22,0,	"Out of space - unable to allocate %u bytes"
// *Cause: The precompiler process ran out of memory.
// *Action: Allocate more memory to the process, then retry.
23,0,	"Unable to log off from ORACLE"
/                               ******
// *Cause: An Oracle connection error occurred while the precompiler was
//         trying to log off, probably because ORACLE has been shut down.
// *Action: Check that ORACLE is available, then retry.
24,0,	"Indicator variable \"%s\" has wrong type or length at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: An indicator variable was not declared in the Declare Section as a
//         2-byte integer.  Indicator variables must be defined as 2-byte
//         integers.
// *Action: Redefine the indicator variable as a 2-byte integer.
25,0,	"Undeclared indicator variable \"%s\" at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: An indicator variable used in a SQL statement was not declared in
//         the Declare Section or its name is misspelled.
// *Action: Add or correct the indicator variable declaration.
26,0,	"Invalid host variable \"%s\" at line %u in file %s"
// *Cause: A host variable used in a SQL statement was not declared properly.
//         Some possible causes follow:
//           o It was not declared in the Declare Section.
//           o Its datatype is not supported.
//           o Its name is misspelled.
//           o It is a COBOL group item; in Pro*COBOL, only elementary items
//             are allowed in a SQL statement.
// *Action: Add or correct the host variable declaration.
27,0,	"Redeclared SQL Identifier \"%s\" at line %u in file %s"
/                   ***
// *Cause: The name of a SQL descriptor, statement, or cursor was re-declared
//         (that is, declared twice)
// *Action: Check the spelling of the identifier, then, if necessary, remove
//          the extra declaration.
28,0,	"Option \"%s\" not legal as EXEC ORACLE OPTION"
/                                   ******************
// *Cause: A precompiler option was specified inline in an EXEC ORACLE
//         statement.  Some options can be specified only on the command line.
//         For example, INAME cannot be specified inline.
// *Action: Respecify the precompiler option on the command line, instead of
//          in an EXEC ORACLE statement.  To see an online display of the
//          precompiler options, enter the precompiler command (with no
//          options) at the operating-system prompt.
29,0,	"Ambiguous option \"%s\""
// *Cause: The name of a precompiler option was abbreviated ambiguously.  For
//         example, MAX= might refer to MAXLITERAL or MAXOPENCURSORS.
// *Action: Respecify the full option name or an unambiguous abbreviation.  To
//          see an online display of the precompiler options, enter the
//          precompiler command (with no options) at the operating-system

// *Action: If tabs are embedded in the source ocde, replace them with spaces.
//          Check the statement syntax and check that each EXEC statement has
