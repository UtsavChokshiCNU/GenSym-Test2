/ 
/       TRANSLATION DOCUMENTATION:
/
/  The following messages are broken down into the following categories:
/
/   1 - 1000: Pro*COBOL Error messages.  These should be translated with
/        some exceptions where a keyword, command line option name or value, 
/        or something similar is mentioned.
/
/   1201 - 1300: Explanatory text for the Pro*COBOL help screen for the 
/        current release of Pro*COBOL.  These should be translated except
/        where option names, values, etc. are mentioned. Words which 
/        should not be translated are marked with "*....*".
/
/   1301 - 1400: Miscellaneous messages for Pro*COBOL.  These should be 
/        translated except where option names, values, etc. are mentioned. 
/        Words which should not be translated are marked with "*....*".
/
/  Restrictions on translations:
/
/   1)  Format strings such as "%s", "%u", etc. are *not* translated.
/
/   2)  Most of the error messages (1-1000) are used as C language format
/       strings and use C formatting (%s, %u, %d, etc.).  The relative
/       order of the formats (%s, etc.) within a particular error message
/       and the phrases that contain them CANNOT be changed without
/       possibly causing a precompiler abort or incorrect information in
/       the error message.  The same situation applies to messages 1301 
/       to 1400.
/
/   3)  Many of the individual words in the messages 1-1000, 1201-1300,
/       1301-1400 are COBOL keywords, SQL keywords, Pro*COBOL command line 
/       option names and values and should *not* be translated.  These 
/       individual words have "*"s underneath them.
/
/   4)  Some terminology is COBOL terminology, such as "Area A" that I am 
/       not sure whether or not it is translated.  The best thing to do here 
/       is to get an American version of a COBOL manual to find out what the
/       term refers to and then to look in a foreign language version of a
/       COBOL manual to see how it is translated.  These are marked 
/       with "L...L".
/
/   5)  Some terms, such as "bind" and "define", are Oracle terms that I do
/       not know if they are translated.  These terms are not marked in
/       any way.  The translator should be generally familiar with the
/       Oracle terminology for the language being translated to.
/
/   ***** - Do not translate this part of otherwise translated text.
/   TTTTT - Translate this part of otherwise untranslated text.
/   LLLLL - COBOL terminology, look in appropriate COBOL manuals for 
/           translations.
/
/
/       SEVERITY AND CATEGORY DOCUMENTATION
/
/    1) The second number represents both severity and category and is derived
/       by multiplying the serverity by 4 and adding the category.  Current
/       values are 
/       Severity                  Category
/       0 - informational         0 - no location information    (command line)
/       1 - warning               1 - line, column and file supplied  (general)
/       2 - severe                2 - location supplied with token     (pxtokn)
/       3 - fatal                 3 - location supplied with idl node   (pcnod)
/
/    2) The error messages are organized using the following categories:
//        1 -  99: command line (option) 
//      100 - 199: file manipulation
//      200 - 299: host variable errors
//      300 - 399: fips flagging errors
//      400 - 499: tokenizer or parsing errors
//      500 - 649: other semantic errors grouped by the following features:
//        threads, result set cursors, miscellaneous, pl/sql, exec tools
//        and lobs.
//      700 - 724: dynamic SQL errors
//      900 - 1000: fatal errors
//
// "1 - 99, Command line (options) errors"
//
1,8, "%s"
// *Cause: This is a generic error message from the command-line processor.
// *Action: Correct the indicated error.
2,8, "Command line processor severe error"
// *Cause: The command line processor encountered a severe error.
// *Action: After making sure that all the command-line options are specified
//          correctly, call customer support with a full account of all the
//          options and configuration files used.
3,8, "Value of DBMS option invalid with given value of MODE option"
/              ****                                    ****
// *Cause: When MODE={ANSI14 | ANSI13}, DBMS=V7 or V8 was specified, or when
//         MODE=ANSI, DBMS=v6 was specified.  These option settings are
//         incompatible.  Note that the DBMS option was not available before
//         release 1.5 of the Oracle Precompilers.
// *Action: With DBMS=V7 or V8, instead of MODE={ANSI14 | ANSI13}, specify
//          MODE={ANSI | ORACLE}.  With DBMS=V6, instead of MODE=ANSI,
//          specify MODE={ANSI14 | ANSI13 | ORACLE}, but MODE=ORACLE is
//          recommended.
4,8, "UNSAFE_NULL=YES must be used with DBMS=V7 or V8 and MODE=ORACLE"
/     ***************                   *******    **     ***********
// *Cause: The option UNSAFE_NULL=YES has been used with DBMS=V6 or
//         DBMS=NATIVE (the default) or has been used with
//         MODE=ANSI/ANSI14/ANSI13.
// *Action: Use DBMS=V7 or V8 and MODE=ORACLE (the default) when using
//         UNSAFE_NULL=YES or do not use UNSAFE_NULL=YES.
5,0, "Command line option MODE=ANSI required with option NLS_LOCAL=YES"
/                         *********                      *************
// *Cause: The precompiler option NLS_LOCAL=YES was used without also
//         specifying MODE=ANSI.  The precompiler option MODE=ANSI must be
//         specifiied if NLS_LOCAL=YES.
// *Action: Set the precompiler option MODE=ANSI in addition to NLS_LOCAL=YES
//          or do not set NLS_LOCAL=YES.
/
6,4, "Userid only used when SQLCHECK=FULL, userid ignored."
/                           *************
// *Cause: The USERID option was specified when SQLCHECK={SYNTAX | NONE}.  This
//         is unnecessary.
// *Action: Specify the USERID option only when SQLCHECK=SEMANTICS.
7,11, "%s"
// *Cause: This is a generic error message from the command-line processor.
// *Action: Correct the indicated error.
8,11,  "Must use option SQLCHECK=SEMANTICS(FULL) when there is embedded PL/SQL"
/                       ************************                        ******
// *Cause: The precompiler tried to parse an embedded PL/SQL block when
//         SQLCHECK={SYNTAX | NONE}.  PL/SQL blocks can be parsed only when
//         SQLCHECK=SEMANTICS is specified.
// *Action: Remove the PL/SQL block or specify SQLCHECK=SEMANTICS.
9,7,  "Cannot change MAXLITERAL after an EXEC SQL statement"
/                     **********          ********
// *Cause: The MAXLITERAL option has been used in an inline EXEC ORACLE OPTION
//         statement after and EXEC SQL, EXEC TOOLS, or EXEC IAF statement.
//         This is not allowed.
// *Action: Use the MAXLITERAL option only on the command line or in an EXEC
//          ORACLE OPTION statement placed at the beginning of the input source
//          file.
10,7,  "SQLCHECK value in EXEC ORACLE statement exceeds command line value"
/       ********          ***********
// *Cause: The SQLCHECK option was entered inline and specified a level of
//         checking higher than the level specified (or accepted by default) on
//         the command line.  This is not allowed.  For example, if
//         SQLCHECK={SYNTAX | LIMITED} is specified on the command line,
//         SQLCHECK={SEMANTICS | FULL} cannot be specified inline.  This
//         informational message is;  the precompiler ignores the inline
//         value and continues processing.
// *Action: Revise the EXEC ORACLE statement or specify a lower level of
//          checking on the command line.
11,4, "DBMS=V6 no longer supported; using DBMS=NATIVE"
/      *******                            ***********
// *Cause: V6 compatibility is no longer supported.  The precompiler will
//         precompile as though DBMS=NATIVE was specified.
// *Action: Revise the specified DBMS option value from v6 to another value
//          as desired.
12,0, "Command line option DYNAMIC=ANSI required with option TYPE_CODE=ANSI"
/                          ************                      **************
// *Cause: The precompiler option TYPE_CODE=ANSI was used without also
//         specifying DYNAMIC=ANSI.  The precompiler option 
//         DYNAMIC=ANSI must be specifiied if TYPE_CODE=ANSI.
// *Action: Set the precompiler option DYNAMIC=ANSI in addition 
//          to TYPE_CODE=ANSI or do not set TYPE_CODE=ANSI.
/
//
// "100 - 199, File manipulation errors"
//
100, 12, "Unable to reopen temporary file %s"
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to reopen a temporary file.
//         Some possible causes follow:
//           o File access privileges are insufficient.
//           o Another user has locked the file.
//           o There is not enough disk space.
//           o There are too many open files.
// *Action: Check that sufficient privileges have been granted to access
//          the file, and that it is not locked by another user.  Also check
//          that there is enough disk space and that the limit for open files
//          is set high enough (check with the system manager).  
101,4, "Could not find or open system configuration file"
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to open the system configuration file.
//         The system configuration file does not exist or is not in the
//         proper directory.
// *Action: Check that the system configuration file is in the proper
//          directory.  See Oracle installation documentation for where this
//          should be.  Put a new copy of pcccob.cfg with desired default
//          options in the proper directory.
102,8, "Input file name length exceeds the maximum length"
// *Cause: The file name length specified exceeded the maximum length.  Some
//         operating systems have a maximum file name length. 
// *Action: Use a file name of length less than or equal to the maximum
//          platform specific file name length.

104,8, "Unable to open input file \"%s\""
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to open the input file specified by the
//         INAME precompiler option.  Some possible causes follow:
//           o The filename is misspelled.
//           o The file does not exist.
//           o The search path to the file is incorrect.
//           o File access privileges are insufficient.

//           o There is not enough disk space.
//           o There are too many open files.
// *Action: Check that the file exists, that the search path to the file is
//          correct, that sufficient privileges have been granted to access the
//          file, and that it is not locked by another user.  Also check that
//          there is enough disk space and that the limit for open files is
//          set high enough (check with the system manager).
105, 9, "Included file name \"%s\" exceeds name limit of %d characters"
// *Cause: The file name length specified exceeded the maximum length.  Some
//         operating systems have a maximum file name length. 
// *Action: Use a file name of length less than or equal to the maximum
//          platform specific file name length.
106, 9, "Unable to open INCLUDE file \"%s\""
/                       *******
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to open the input file specified in the
//         INCLUDE statement.  Some possible causes follow:
//           o The filename is misspelled.
//           o The file does not exist.

108, 12, "Unable to open list file \"%s\"" 
// *Cause: The precompiler was unable to open the list file specified by the

// *Cause: The host variable and attribute pairing in a LOB DESCRIBE was
//         invalid.  Most likely, this was due to some problem with the host
//         variable.  For example, this error could occur if the host variable
//         was not declared.
// *Action: Usually, other, more specific, errors will accompany this one.
//          Correcting some or all of those problems should resolve this error.

// *Cause: A request for a LOB attribute was made in a LOB DESCRIBE
//         statement in which the given LOB was not of some Internal LOB
//         type.
// *Action: Replace the LOB host variable in the LOB DESCRIBE with one

// *Cause: A host variable was given that was not declared to be of some
